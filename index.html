Hi! I'm Chicago Coconut! I am from Connecticut and arrived in Chicago via Rockefeller Center USPS. I was on my way to Notre Dame and I lost my way, but I found myself in Chicago! I'm gonna like it here!

You can order one of my friends below! A Comfort Coconut arrives in its brown fur with the stamp attached- no packaging! A Deluxe Comfort Coconut arrives in painted fur and also arrives without packaging! They make the perfect quarantine companions!
